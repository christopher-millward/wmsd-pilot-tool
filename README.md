# Bartender WMSD Pilot Study Questionnaire Tool

This is the questionnaire tool used to collect data for my 2024 pilot study investigating the injury prevalence and barriers to injury reporting among Canadian bartenders. The frontend was created using React.js and the backend was created using Express.js. 

All work was performed by Christopher Millward. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at cmillwar@uwo.ca.
