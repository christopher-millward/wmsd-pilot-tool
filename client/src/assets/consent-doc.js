    <h2>Letter of Informed Consent (Administered Online)</h2>
    <p>
        You are invited to participate in a research study investigating work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among bartenders. Specifically, this study will look at:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>WMSD Injury prevalence</li>
        <li>Factors influencing injury prevalence and severity</li>
        <li>Common barriers preventing workers from reporting their injuries</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        within the bar industry. The results of this study will help define the common risk factors and injury types associated with the job and will go on to influence future guidelines for injury prevention, including (but not limited to): improved awareness of injury risks, workspace and equipment (re)design, training, and safety culture.
    </p>
    <p>
        This following information is given below to facilitate an informed decision regarding study participation. You are free to withdraw from the study at any time.

    <h3>1. Purpose of this Study</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this study is to document and quantify the severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among bartenders. In addition, the study will gather data regarding bartenders’ opinions and attitudes of workplace safety and any potential barriers that may exist within the industry. This investigation will serve as an initial pilot study, surveying bartenders only within London, Ontario. The information gathered during this investigation will be used to influence both future research projects and, hopefully, decisions regarding improved workplace design and operating procedures for workers in the restaurant and bar industry.
    </p>
    <h3>2. The Study’s Structure and Timeline</h3>
    <p>
        An online questionnaire will be administered to local bartenders during the summer of 2024. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to complete this online survey.

All responses will be collected anonymously to ensure participant confidentiality.
